### README: How to clone this repository

This is an Git LFS repository. You need to run this to clone it properly on the Nano (otherwise all the prebuilt wheels won't be cloned). This will install git-lfs, and only after that clone the repo.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adumont/jetson-nano/master/clone.sh -O - | bash
```

You can do it all with this command:
